class NLPScoreType:
    """Initializes an ``NLPScoreType`` instance.

    It wraps score names and their corresponding word lists used for NLP scoring.

    It provides an organized standard for passing required data to an NLPScorerConfig
    and defines several constants, such as ``POSITIVE`` and ``READABILITY``, which can be used
    to perform NLP scoring using SageMaker JumpStart Industry's internal word lists.

    A single ``NLPScoreType`` or a list of ``NLPScoreTypes`` is required
    when initializing an :class:`~smjsindustry.NLPScorerConfig`. Passing the data required by
    the :class:`~smjsindustry.NLPScorerConfig` via ``NLPScoreTypes`` ensures that any potential
    errors which could affect the creation of the config are caught
    at the earliest possible stage.

    To create an ``NLPScoreType`` using SageMaker JumpStart Industry's internal word lists, use
    an ``NLPScoreType`` constant (such as ``NLPScoreType.POSITIVE``) for the ``score_name``
    argument, and either ``[]`` or ``None`` for the ``word_list`` argument.

    Args:
        score_name (str):
            A name that describes the overall topic represented by the words in
            the ``word_list`` argument. For example, if the ``word_list`` argument is
            ``["promising", "prodigy", "talented", "adept"]``,
            the ``score_name`` argument could be ``"talent"``.

            SageMaker JumpStart Industry has internal
            word lists corresponding to the following
            ``score_name`` values:
            ``NLPScoreType.POSITIVE``, ``NLPScoreType.NEGATIVE``, ``NLPScoreType.POLARITY``,
            ``NLPScoreType.CERTAINTY``, ``NLPScoreType.UNCERTAINTY``, ``NLPScoreType.FRAUD``,
            ``NLPScoreType.LITIGIOUS``, ``NLPScoreType.RISK``, ``NLPScoreType.SAFE``,
            ``NLPScoreType.READABILITY``, ``NLPScoreType.SENTIMENT``.
        word_list (List[str]):
            A list of words corresponding to the topic indicated by ``score_name``.

            The following ``score_names`` values require the ``word_list`` argument to be ``None``
            (the remaining score names require ``word_list`` to be ``[]``):
            ``NLPScoreType.POLARITY``, ``NLPScoreType.READABILITY``, ``NLPScoreType.SENTIMENT``.
